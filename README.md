My work supporting Ben Hampstead's volumetric analysis of T1s. Lots of freesurfer.

W, 20150225: movies for screenshots
=======================================
Below: links to cortical thickness correlation movies intended to be the source
of screenshots for figures. Each movie contains a fast rotation and a slow
rotation of three surfaces: uninflated, plump, and fully inflated.

Colormaps represent spearman rank correlation coefficients for relationship
between cortical thickness (freesurfer) and Ben's measure of behavioral change
after either anode or cathode treatment. Threshold for color visibility is
p=0.05 uncorrected for multiple comparisons.

Each movie is approximately 100 MB:
